Histogram Analysis and Contrast Enhancement: This project explores fundamental image processing techniques through histogram analysis and contrast enhancement. The provided image depicts instructions and prompts for the project, but it lacks an actual input image for demonstration purposes. 

**Functionality Breakdown:**

1. **Image Reading:** The program reads an input image in color format (RGB or BGR). You'll need to choose an image that suits your preference, considering factors like brightness, darkness, or contrast level.
2. **Grayscale Conversion:** The program converts the input image from color to grayscale format. This simplifies the analysis and processing steps.
3. **Histogram Visualization:** The program generates and displays the histogram of the grayscale image. The histogram represents the distribution of pixel intensities across the image.
4. **Histogram Feature Extraction:** The program calculates and prints key features of the histogram that can be used to characterize its shape. These features might include measures like mean, median, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, or entropy.
5. **Contrast Enhancement:** The program implements two methods to enhance the image contrast:
    - **Manual Intensity Transformation:** This involves manually defining a transformation function to map input pixel intensities to output intensities. The specific function can be chosen based on the desired contrast manipulation.
    - **Histogram Equalization:** This technique automatically adjusts the image's intensity distribution to create a more uniform histogram, often resulting in improved contrast.
6. **Output and Comparison:** The program presents the original image, the grayscale version, and the contrast-enhanced versions obtained from both methods. This allows for visual comparison and evaluation of the effectiveness of each technique.
